# Outreach — Brand Guidelines

## Logo

### Concept

The logo combines the letter "o" with ripples radiating outward. The "o" is organic and hand-drawn — not perfectly circular, not sterile. The ripples represent a voice going out, a signal extending, a breath before speaking. Someone reaching out and being pulled up.

### Icon Description

- Central "o" shape: thick, organic, slightly imperfect stroke
- Ripple lines: curved lines radiating outward from the "o" in multiple directions
- Style: hand-drawn quality with confidence in roughness — human, not machine-made
- Asymmetric: not perfectly symmetrical, intentionally organic

### Logo Versions

1. **Icon only** — for app icon, favicon, small uses
2. **Icon + wordmark** — horizontal lockup, primary logo
3. **Dark mode** — teal icon on charcoal background (primary)
4. **Light mode** — charcoal icon on warm off-white background (secondary)

### Wordmark

- Text: `outreach`
- Case: lowercase
- Font: Source Serif 4 (free on Google Fonts)

## Colors

### Primary Palette

| Role | Hex | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Background (Dark) | `#1C1C1C` | Deep charcoal — quiet, grounded, not trying to impress |
| Accent | `#4A9B9B` | Muted teal — calm determination, clear, has depth without shouting |
| Text (Light) | `#F5F0EB` | Warm off-white — softer than pure white, less sterile |

### Light Mode

| Role | Hex |
|------|-----|
| Background | `#F5F0EB` |
| Icon/Text | `#1C1C1C` |
| Accent | `#4A9B9B` |

### Color Philosophy

- **Why not pure black:** Too harsh. Deep charcoal feels grounded without being aggressive.
- **Why not bright blue:** Too corporate, too "trust me." Outreach doesn't ask for trust — it earns it by working.
- **Why not orange/red:** Too energetic, too urgent. This isn't about hype.
- **Why muted teal:** Calm but not cold. Clear. Quiet confidence — present but not performative.

## Typography

### Primary Font: Source Serif 4

- Source: Google Fonts (free for commercial use)
- Use: Logo wordmark, headings, titles
- Character: Classic, grounded, timeless with quiet sophistication
- Why: Adds warmth and depth — feels literary and thoughtful without being stuffy

### Secondary Font: Satoshi

- Source: Fontshare.com (free for commercial use)
- Use: Body text, UI elements, labels, buttons
- Weights: Regular/Medium/Bold
- Character: Clean, geometric, confident without being cold

### Typography Pairing

The combination of Source Serif 4 (headers) + Satoshi (body) creates contrast between timeless sophistication and modern functionality. Classic meets tool. Thoughtful meets efficient.

### Typography Guidelines

- Use lowercase for the wordmark
- Source Serif 4 for all headings and display text
- Satoshi for body copy, UI, and functional text
- Avoid rounded, bubbly fonts (no Nunito, Quicksand, Poppins)
- Maintain generous spacing — let it breathe

## Usage Notes

### Do

- Use the logo with adequate whitespace

- Keep colors consistent across applications
- Let the design breathe — minimalism is key

### Don't

- Stretch or distort the logo
- Add effects (shadows, glows, gradients)
- Place on busy backgrounds
- Use off-brand colors
- Make it "cleaner" or more geometric — the imperfection is intentional

## Summary

Outreach's brand is quiet confidence. It doesn't shout, doesn't convince, doesn't try to impress. It just works. The visual identity reflects this: organic but grounded, warm but not soft, present but not loud.

When in doubt, ask: "Does this feel like relief?" If yes, it's on brand.
