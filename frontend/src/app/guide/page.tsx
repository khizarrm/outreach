                  <p>Hey Kyle,</p>
                  <p>I'm Khizar, CS @ Carleton in the Co-op programme. Been making AI applications for 2+ years, quite good with building end to end products.</p>
                  <p>I really admire what you're building at Fullscript. Making healthcare more accessible is pretty cool, your mission is inspiring. I'm reaching out because I'd love the opportunity to contribute to your team.</p>
                  <p>Some of my past projects include:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
                    <li>thirdspace, a social networking app to share experiences (1,000+ users, ranked top 70 in the App Store)</li>
                    <li>passr, a resume optimization platform where users can directly prompt their resumes (40+ active users)</li>
                    <li>A chrome extension which uses a custom ML model to determine if a website is considered 'productive' or 'unproductive' (launching this week)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I'm free this fall. If you're open to it, I'd be happy to chat further.</p>
