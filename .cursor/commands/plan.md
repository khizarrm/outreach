We are working on [FEATURE/BUG]. Research has been completed above.
Goal: Provide an implementation checklist in markdown format.
Instructions:
1. Create a checklist with atomic implementation steps.
2. Each step must be:
    * Atomic: One clear action (e.g., 'Create file X', 'Add function Y to file Z')
    * Verifiable: Include a check to ensure it works (e.g., 'Run test X', 'Verify log output')
    * No Code: Instructions only, not actual code
Format:


[ ] Step 1: [Action] - [Verification]
[ ] Step 2: [Action] - [Verification]
Return the plan in markdown format. Do not implement yet.
